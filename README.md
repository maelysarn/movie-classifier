I will also add the files used as movies records. 
Most of them will have the right structure, meaning:
Year, Title, Duration in minutes, Genre, Rating, Score, Director, Actor1, Actor2, Actor3

There are a few other restrictions when cleaning the files and discarding the "bad" records of movie files, but when i wrote this program most of them
were based on the structure of the record :)
